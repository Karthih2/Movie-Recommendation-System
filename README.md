# Movie-Recommendation-System
This project is a content-based movie recommendation web application that analyzes movie metadata (genre, cast, director, keywords) and provides accurate similarity-based movie recommendations. The system integrates with the TMDB API to fetch movie posters, trailers, and trending movies.
